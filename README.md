## Description
The objective of this assignment was to use the starter code provided and add the api routes and all the models so that the routes connect to the database to be able to view all, view by id, post to the database, update a file, and delete by id. 

To start, I created all of the models using the guidelines in the assignment including the index.js file in the models folder to do all the joins. Next, I updated the category-routes, product-routes, and the tag-routes. 

## Installation
Clone the project to your local computer than run an npm install.

## Usage
To use this project, first make sure to create the database by coping the schema and seeds files in the db folder to MySQL Workbench or other similar application. Next, type "npm install" in your terminal to install all the dependencies. Make sure to create a ".env" file using the .env.Example. To seed your database, type in "node seeds/index.js". To start the server, type "node server.js" in the terminal and respond to all the prompts. Finally go to Insomnia and use the following routes: localhost:3001/api/categories, localhost:3001/api/products, and localhost:3001/api/tags.
